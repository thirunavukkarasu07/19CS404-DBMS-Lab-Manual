# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views

## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**
--
Write a SQL query that retrieve all the columns from the table "Grades", where the grade is equal to the maximum grade achieved in each subject.
Sample table: GRADES (attributes: student_id, student_name, subject, grade)

```
SELECT *
FROM GRADES g
WHERE grade = (
    SELECT MAX(grade)
    FROM GRADES
    WHERE subject = g.subject
);

```

**Output:**

**Question 2**
---
Write a SQL query to Identify customers whose city is different from the city of the customer with the highest ID

SAMPLE TABLE: customer
```
name             type
---------------  ---------------
id               INTEGER
name             TEXT
city             TEXT
email            TEXT
phone            INTEGER
```
```
SELECT *
FROM customer
WHERE city <> (
    SELECT city
    FROM customer
    WHERE id = (SELECT MAX(id) FROM customer)
);

```

**Output:**
